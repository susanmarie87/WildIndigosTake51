 # UX
*   As a user, I want to browse merchandise.

     The merchandise section can be found by clicking “Products” on the navigation bar. Upon arrival to the products page, user can use scroll feature to find the specific card for bracelets. 
     The user will then be greeted with a “Coming Soon” button as this is MS1 and I have yet to learn how to implement a wide variety of products or a shopping cart. 

* As a user, I want to search for body products.

    The body products section can be found by clicking “Products” on the navigation bar. Upon arrival to the products page, user can use scroll feature to find the specific card for bracelets.

# Deployment

* Wild Indigos has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

* All code was written on Gitpod, a cloud-based IDE.

* The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my Repository.

* Under the Settings section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to GitHub Pages section.

* Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.

* Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

* There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

* The code can be run locally through clone or download. You can do this by opening the repository,
  clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

* The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.

* The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine or uploaded to your cloud-based IDE workspace.

 # Acknowledgements

*	Code Institute

*	ALL of the Tutors who have helped me up to this point.

*	Slack. For where would any new developers be without Slack? Shoutout to old school developers that had to learn without that support system. 
    Specifically Anna Greaves and Simen Daehlin aka "Grandmaster Yoda," as it is always, at least 95% of the time, their answers that pop-up when I search for something on Slack. 
    Those two could run the entire code world. 

*	Ignatius Ukwuoma, my mentor, for helping to guide me through ideas for my project and giving me motivation.

*	Jim Lynx for helping me sort out a bracket and CSS issues as well as the valuable feedback and advice when I was ready to quit. Jim is a coding natural and should be hired immediately at
    Code Institute as a mentor upon completion. Or now for MS1 projects. 

*	Kevin Powell and his very awesome and concise videos. 

*	Learn Code Institute for their videos as well.
